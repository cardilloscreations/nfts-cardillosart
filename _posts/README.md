# Notes on Project Posts

A collection of reminders when creating new project posts.


## Reminders

- Add <> around links because I've enabled kramdown markdown processing.
- Be sure to use "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━" because that's used to mark the excerpt.
- Fix the excerpt section if needed (e.g., playlist links, etc).


## Resources

- **/images/project/** - contains the post header image and I will name them after the post so they're consistent.
- **/assets/** - contains any additional images or resources that are being hosted and served for the post.


## Categories

The categories must be predefined because I can't use the archive plugin on Jekyll pages.
See the [./_pages/categories] directory for more.


## Tags

Tags must also be predefined because I can't use the archive plugin on Jekyll pages.
See the [./_pages/tags] directory for more.
